# **Question 1:**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
turnout = read.csv("turnout.csv")
```


### **Part A:**

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
prop_voted98 = prop(~voted1998,data=filter(turnout,GOTV_call==1))
prop_voted98

prop_novote98 = prop(~voted1998,data=filter(turnout,GOTV_call==0))
prop_novote98

propvote_boot = do(100)*diffprop(voted1998~GOTV_call, data=resample(turnout))

propvote_confint = confint(propvote_boot,level=.95)
propvote_confint

```
The proportion of those who voted in 1998 who received a call was about .65. The proportion of those who voted in 1998 who did not receive a call was about .44. The confidence interval for the difference in these proportions is `r round(propvote_confint$lower,2)` to `r round(propvote_confint$upper,2)`.

### **Part B:**

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Proving voted1996 as a confounder
lm_v96 = lm(voted1998 ~ GOTV_call + voted1996, data = turnout)

xtabs(~ voted1996 + voted1998, data=turnout) %>%
  prop.table(margin=2)
```
The table demonstrates that those who voted in 1996 were more likely to vote in 1998, which is the proportion of voters in 1998, meaning that voted1996 is a confounder.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Proving MAJORPRTY as a confounder
lm_party = lm(voted1998 ~ GOTV_call + MAJORPTY, data = turnout)

xtabs(~ MAJORPTY + voted1998, data=turnout) %>%
  prop.table(margin=2)
```
Like with voted1996, this table demonstrates that registration with a party led to a higher chance of voting in 1998, meaning that it as also a confounder.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Proving AGE as a confounder
lm_AGE = lm(voted1998 ~ GOTV_call + AGE, data = turnout)

diffmean(AGE~voted1998,data=turnout)
mean_votedage = mean(~AGE,data=filter(turnout,voted1998==TRUE))
mean_novoteage = mean(~AGE,data=filter(turnout,voted1998==FALSE))

boot_meandiffage = do(100)*diffmean(AGE ~ voted1998,data=resample(turnout))
confint_meandiffage = confint(boot_meandiffage, level = .95)
```
The mean age of those who did not vote was around 45 years old, while the mean of those who did vote was 55, with a confidence interval of about `r round(confint_meandiffage$lower,2)` to `r round(confint_meandiffage$upper,2)`. This means that age is also a confounder for voted1998.

### **Part C:**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
turnout_match = matchit(GOTV_call ~ voted1996 + AGE + MAJORPTY, data = turnout, ratio = 5)
turnout_matched = match.data(turnout_match)

lm_match = lm(voted1998 ~ GOTV_call, data = turnout_matched)
coef(lm_match)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Prove voted1996 is no longer confounding:
xtabs(~ voted1996 + GOTV_call, data=turnout_matched) %>%
  prop.table(margin=2)
```
After matching, this table demonstrated nearly identical proportions of those who received a GOTV call, meaning that voted1996 is no longer confounding
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Prove MAJORPTY is no longer confounding:
xtabs(~ MAJORPTY + GOTV_call, data=turnout_matched) %>%
  prop.table(margin=2)
```
After matching, this table demonstrated nearly identical proportions of those who received a GOTV call, meaning that MAJORPTY is no longer confounding
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Prove AGE is no longer confounding:
mean(AGE ~ GOTV_call, data=turnout_matched)
```
The mean age for those who got a call and those who did not is the almost the same, meaning that AGE is no longer a confounder.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
n = diffprop(voted1998~GOTV_call,data=turnout_matched)
```
The difference in proportions for whether or not voters who received a GOTV call or didn't is about `round(n,2)`, meaning that the GOTV calls likely had a small effect on voters. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# **Question 2:**
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
solder = read.csv("solder.csv")
```

### **Part A:**
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(solder,aes(x=Opening,y=skips)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color='orchid4',fill='orchid2') + xlab("Size of Opening") + ylab("Skips") + ggtitle("Skips by Size of Opening") + theme_minimal()
```

This plot demonstrates that as the opening hole gets larger, the number of skips rises as well

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(solder,aes(x=Solder,y=skips)) + 
  geom_boxplot(color='skyblue4',fill='skyblue2') + xlab("Size of Opening") + ylab("Skips") + ggtitle("Skips by Thickness of Solder") + theme_minimal()
```

This plot demonstrates that thick solders lead to less skipping than thin solders.

### **Part B:**
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
lm_skips = lm(skips~Solder + Opening + Solder:Opening,data=solder)

boot_lmskips = do(100)*lm(skips~Solder + Opening + Solder:Opening,data=resample(solder))


skips_coefs = tidy(lm_skips)
skips_coefs[1,1] = 'Intercept'
skips_coefs[5,1] = 'SolderThin.OpeningM'
skips_coefs[6,1] = 'SolderThin.OpeningS'

skips_confint = confint(boot_lmskips,level=.95)
colnames(skips_coefs) = c("name","estimate","std error","statistic","p.value")
skips_table = merge(skips_coefs,skips_confint,by='name')

skips_table = select(skips_table,name,estimate.x,lower,upper)
colnames(skips_table) = c("Name","Coefficient","Lower","Upper")
skips_table = kable(skips_table)
skips_table
```

### **Part C:**
The baseline is around .39. This is the intercept for the number of skips when the solder is thick and the opening is large.

The next coefficient is SolderThin, which is 2.28. This demonstrates that on average, a thin solder means about 2.28 more skips than a thick solder with a large opening

The next coefficient is OpeningM, which is 2.41. This demonstrates that on average a medium opening leads to about 2.41 more skips than the baseline

The next coefficient is OpeningS, which is 5.13. This demonstrates that on average a small opening leads to about 5.13 more skips than the baseline

The next coefficient is SolderThin:OpeningM, which is -.74. This represents the effect of the interaction of a thin solder and a medium opening and demosntrates that on average a medium opening and thin solder leads to about .74 LESS skips than the baseline

The next coefficient is SolderThin:OpeningS, which is 9.65 This represents the effect of the interaction of a thin solder and a small opening and demosntrates that on average a small opening and thin solder leads to about 9.65 more skips than the baseline

### **Part D:**
If I were to recommend an opening size and solder thickness combination to AT&T in order to minimize the number of skips I would recommend a medium opening with a thin solder size, as it was the only coefficient that was negative, meaning that it actually led to less skips than the baseline.
